# Bulls and Cows Game

A simple text-based implementation of the classic "Bulls and Cows" game in Python. The game generates a random 4-digit number with unique digits (no leading zero), and the player guesses it, receiving feedback in the form of "bulls" (correct digits in the correct position) and "cows" (correct digits in the wrong position).
